I plan to use this page to collect expository notes and computations related to my research interests in algebraic geometry, particularly:

- examples of KSBA moduli spaces of surfaces,
- explicit descriptions of moduli of del Pezzo surfaces and their degenerations,
- computations of tautological classes (such as \(\kappa\)-classes) on low-dimensional moduli spaces,
- and concrete blowup and intersection-theoretic examples that illustrate general phenomena.

These notes are currently in preparation. As they are revised and polished, I will make selected documents available here.

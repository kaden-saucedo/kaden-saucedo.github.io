I am a **PhD student** in the Department of Mathematics at the [**University of Georgia**](https://www.uga.edu), where I study **algebraic geometry** under the direction of [**Valery Alexeev**](https://www.math.uga.edu/directory/people/valery-alexeev).

I study the geometry of moduli spaces, with a focus on moduli of [del Pezzo surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del_Pezzo_surface) and their KSBA compactifications. Much of my work involves explicit intersection-theoretic calculations, which help clarify how birational geometry influences the structure of these spaces. I am especially interested in concrete settings where these ideas can be computed and understood in detail.

At the moment, my main project focuses on degree $$4$$ del Pezzo surfaces: I am working to understand how $$\kappa$$-classes generate and intersect in the Chow ring of the moduli space, and how these classes behave under variations of weights on the boundary (in the spirit of Hassett’s weighted stable curves).

On this site, you can find information about my [**research**](/research), [**teaching**](/teaching), and future [**notes and expository writing**](/notes) in algebraic geometry.

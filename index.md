I am a **PhD student** in the Department of Mathematics at the [**University of Georgia**](https://www.uga.edu), where I study **algebraic geometry** under the direction of [**Valery Alexeev**](https://www.math.uga.edu/directory/people/valery-alexeev).

Broadly, I am interested in moduli spaces of surfaces and their tautological geometry. More specifically, I am currently studying the tautological classes on moduli spaces of stable marked del Pezzo surfaces, with an emphasis on the $$\kappa$$-classes and their behavior in KSBA compactifications.

At the moment, my main project focuses on degree $$4$$ [del Pezzo surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del_Pezzo_surface): I am working to understand how $$\kappa$$-classes generate and intersect in the Chow ring of the moduli space, and how these classes behave under variations of weights on the boundary (in the spirit of Hassett’s weighted stable curves).

On this site, you can find information about my [**research**](/research), [**teaching**](/teaching), and future [**notes and expository writing**](/notes) in algebraic geometry.

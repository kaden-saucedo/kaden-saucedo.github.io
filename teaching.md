I am currently an instructor and teaching assistant in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Georgia. I have taught both precalculus and calculus, and I enjoy helping students build a solid conceptual foundation that makes later courses in mathematics and the sciences more accessible.

I value clear explanations, well-chosen examples, and a classroom environment where students feel comfortable asking questions and working through mistakes. My goal is to help students see mathematics as something coherent and understandable, rather than a collection of disconnected rules.

## **Directed Reading Program**

I have mentored two undergraduate students through UGA’s Directed Reading Program:

- **Spring 2025:** An introduction to **category theory**, focusing on basic categorical language and examples relevant to algebra and topology.
- **Fall 2025:** An introduction to **algebraic surfaces**, emphasizing concrete examples and the geometry of blowups.

I enjoy DRP-style mentoring because it allows students to explore advanced topics at their own pace, while learning how to read mathematics independently and discuss it in a research-like setting.

## **Teaching Materials**

I do not currently post course materials or handouts here, but I may add selected review sheets and notes in the future.

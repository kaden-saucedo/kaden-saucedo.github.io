I am currently an instructor and teaching assistant in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Georgia.

I approach teaching mathematics with the goal of helping students think carefully, justify their ideas, and build confidence in their own reasoning. In my courses, I emphasize that mathematics is not just about getting the right answer, but about understanding why a method works and when it should be used. Algebra is an important tool in these courses, but I try to keep it in the background so that students can focus on the underlying concepts and learn to recognize them on their own. A course is successful, in my view, when students leave believing that they are capable of working through new problems independently, even when the material feels challenging.

To support this, I structure my classes around active work and discussion rather than lecture. Students engage with new material before class, and class time is spent working through problems together, comparing approaches, and discussing why certain ideas apply. I encourage students to share incomplete thoughts, make guesses, and work through mistakes openly. Misunderstandings, especially misreading a problem or choosing the wrong approach, often lead to the most productive conversations and help clarify the structure of the material. In the classroom, I aim to be an active presence: listening to students’ ideas, asking guiding questions, and working through problems alongside them. I try to create an environment where students feel supported in struggling with difficult ideas and where persistence, careful reasoning, and honest engagement are valued more than quick answers.

## Advice for students
I keep a running page of recommendations for succeeding in math courses and in college more broadly.

## **Directed Reading Program**

I have mentored two undergraduate students through UGA’s [Directed Reading Program (DRP)](https://www.math.uga.edu/directed-reading-program):

- **Spring 2025:** An introduction to **category theory**, focusing on basic categorical language and examples relevant to algebra and topology.
- **Fall 2025:** An introduction to **algebraic surfaces**, emphasizing concrete examples and the geometry of blowups.

I enjoy DRP-style mentoring because it allows students to explore advanced topics at their own pace, while learning how to read mathematics independently and discuss it in a research-like setting.

## **Teaching Materials**

I do not currently post course materials or handouts here, but I may add selected review sheets and notes in the future.

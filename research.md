# **Research**

My research focuses on moduli spaces of surfaces, especially quartic del Pezzo surfaces and their weighted variants. I am currently working on κ-class computations for these moduli spaces, using KSBA-stability and explicit intersection-theoretic techniques. These del Pezzo examples are guided by the combinatorics of surface degenerations, including relationships with Weyl groups and associated graphs. I am generally motivated by settings where concrete examples illuminate how intersection theory, combinatorics, and birational geometry interact.

I am particularly interested in:

- **KSBA moduli of surfaces:** compactified moduli spaces of well-behaved surface pairs, especially del Pezzo surfaces.
- **Tautological classes on moduli spaces:** in particular the $$\kappa$$-classes, their intersection theory, and their role in the structure of the Chow ring.
- **Del Pezzo surfaces and their degenerations:** understanding how del Pezzo surfaces fit into KSBA compactifications and how their degenerations are reflected in boundary strata.

Some guiding questions for my work include:

- What can we say about the **birational geometry** of KSBA spaces of well-behaved surfaces?
- Do tautological classes such as the $$\kappa$$-classes satisfy **nice structural properties** on these moduli spaces—for instance, generating the Chow ring or enjoying functorial behavior under natural morphisms?
- When we introduce **weights** (as in Hassett’s spaces for curves, or rational weights on boundary divisors for del Pezzo surfaces of fixed degree), how do the $$\kappa$$-classes **change under wall-crossing** between chambers?

## **Current Project**

### *Kappa Classes on Moduli of Stable Marked Degree 4 del Pezzo Surfaces*  
_In preparation (expected 2025)_

This project studies the tautological $$\kappa$$-classes on the moduli space of stable marked degree $$4$$ del Pezzo surfaces in the KSBA sense. The main goals are:

- to **compute the $$\kappa$$-classes** on this moduli space and show that they satisfy properties analogous to those of $$\kappa$$-classes on the moduli space of stable curves of genus zero with marked points, and  
- to show that these $$\kappa$$-classes **generate the Chow ring** (or an appropriate tautological subring) of the moduli space.

In addition, I investigate the **intersection theory** of these $$\kappa$$-classes, computing their intersections inside the Chow ring. A further direction considers **weighted** stable marked degree $$4$$ del Pezzo surfaces, in which rational weights are placed on boundary components. In this setting, I study how the $$\kappa$$-classes transform as one crosses walls in the space of weights, in analogy with wall-crossing phenomena for Hassett’s moduli spaces of weighted pointed curves.

## **Related Interests**

Although my primary focus is currently on the degree $$4$$ case, I am broadly interested in extending these questions to:

- other degrees of del Pezzo surfaces,
- other classes of surfaces amenable to KSBA compactifications, and
- comparisons between the behavior of $$\kappa$$-classes on moduli of surfaces and on moduli of curves.
